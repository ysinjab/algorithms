# Algorithms

After I got rejected by one of the FAANG companies during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown I've decided to re-build my knowledge and study algorithms & data structures. I would like to share my progress with the world. Here you can find breif descriptions about algorithms and their implementation written in Python or C#.

My resources are:
 - [MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)
 - [MIT Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/)
 - [The Algorithm Design Manual book by Steven Skiena](http://mimoza.marmara.edu.tr/~msakalli/cse706_12/SkienaTheAlgorithmDesignManual.pdf)
